# Active Context - ZKane Professional Design Transformation

## Current Task
The current task is to ensure the ZKane frontend is stable, fully functional, and ready for deployment. This includes resolving any outstanding bugs, updating documentation, and verifying that all features are working as expected.

## Design Transformation Overview
The frontend has undergone a significant design transformation, moving from a basic interface to an enterprise-grade privacy infrastructure design.

### Key Design Shifts
1. **Visual Identity**: From emoji-based to professional geometric iconography
2. **Color Palette**: Sophisticated cryptographic blues, Bitcoin orange, zero-knowledge purple
3. **Typography**: Technical precision with Inter font family and clear hierarchy
4. **Layout**: Mathematical proportions using golden ratio and 8px grid system
5. **Interactions**: Cryptographic-inspired animations and micro-interactions

## Implementation Strategy
The implementation has followed a phased approach, starting with the foundation and moving through core components, page redesigns, and finally polish and optimization.

## Success Metrics
- **User Experience**: The application is now much more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Technical**: The application is stable and performant, with a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **Business**: The professional design makes the application more appealing to enterprise users.

## Next Steps
1.  **Final Verification**: Perform a final round of testing to ensure all features are working correctly.
2.  **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a production environment.
3.  **Monitoring**: Monitor the application for any issues and gather user feedback.

The design successfully transforms ZKane into sophisticated privacy infrastructure while maintaining the accessibility needed for mainstream adoption.
