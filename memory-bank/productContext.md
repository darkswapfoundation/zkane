# ZKane Product Context

## Product Vision
ZKane is enterprise-grade privacy infrastructure for Bitcoin's alkanes metaprotocol, providing sophisticated zero-knowledge privacy pools that enable anonymous transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of Bitcoin.

## Problem Statement
Current alkanes transactions on Bitcoin lack privacy, creating several critical issues:

1. **Transaction Linkability**: All transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain
2. **Address Clustering**: Users can be tracked across multiple transactions
3. **Financial Privacy**: Transaction amounts and patterns are exposed
4. **Enterprise Adoption Barriers**: Businesses need privacy for competitive reasons
5. **Individual Privacy Rights**: Users deserve financial privacy as a fundamental right

## Solution Approach
ZKane solves these problems through:

### Zero-Knowledge Privacy Pools
- **Anonymous Deposits**: Users deposit assets into shared pools
- **Private Withdrawals**: Zero-knowledge proofs enable withdrawal without revealing deposit history
- **Configurable Denominations**: Multiple pool sizes for different use cases
- **Anonymity Sets**: Larger pools provide stronger privacy guarantees

### Technical Innovation
- **Client-Side Processing**: No trusted third parties or servers
- **Cryptographic Guarantees**: Mathematical privacy proofs, not just obfuscation
- **Bitcoin Native**: Built specifically for alkanes on Bitcoin
- **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable code
